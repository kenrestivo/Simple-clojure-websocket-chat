# Simple Clojure Websockets Chat

Simple chatroom demo, written in Clojure, using webbit.

This was just an experiment. I used it as a back-end for another experiment. It's now in production on at least one website though.

## Usage

Just start the server using "lein run".

There's some Javascript boilerplate for exercising the server is in test/webbittest.js, which you can execute in your browser's Javascript REPL (i.e. FIrebug or the Chrome console, etc).
