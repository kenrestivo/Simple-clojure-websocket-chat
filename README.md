# Simple Clojure Websockets Chat

Simple chatroom demo, written in Clojure, using webbit.

I'm new to Clojuer; this was just an experiment. I used it as a back-end for another experiment.

## Usage

Just start the server using "lein run".

Ther's some Javascript boilerplate for exercising the server is in test/webbittest.js, which you can execute in your browser's Javascript REPL (i.e. FIrebug or the Chrome console, etc).
